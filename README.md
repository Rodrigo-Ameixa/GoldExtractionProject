# GoldExtractionProject
This project was provided by Zyfra and my goal is to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model  that predicts the amount of gold extracted from a gold ore.
The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.
I need to: Prepare the data, perform data analysis & develop and train a model.
